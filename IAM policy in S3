Both the IAM policy or the bucket policy can work to-gather basically what's going on we ad a policy to a user a IAM user for the perticular service for the restiction to the service like in s3 have only need to upload no it not 
download object from the bucket so we add a policy on th IAM user only put in the bucket .

first go to the IAM dashbord then create the policy or edit also  then swith to json formate na add this policy and change it based upon requirnment 

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-hitteshhhbucket"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-hitteshhhbucket/*"
    }
  ]
}


The command for the cli for create the IAM policy :-

aws iam create-policy --policy-name MyS3FullAccessPolicy --policy-document file://s3-policy.json


when the policy created  filter your policy from the filter Costomer managed policy located  select the policy and attech to the user  :- 

it work only if the bucket is private not work on the public bucket 

aws iam attach-user-policy --user-name YourUserName --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws-account-id:policy/YourPolicyName
